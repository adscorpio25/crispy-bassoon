        <h2>About OneRebublic</h2>
        OneRepublic is an American pop rock band formed in Colorado Springs, Colorado,[5] in 2002. It consists of lead
        vocalist and multi-instrumentalist Ryan Tedder, lead guitarist and violist Zach Filkins, rhythm guitarist Drew
        Brown, bassist and cellist Brent Kutzle, drummer Eddie Fisher and keyboardist and violinist Brian Willett.

        Ryan Tedder and Zach Filkins formed the pop/rock band OneRepublic in Colorado Springs, Colorado, in 2002. They
        first drew attention as an unsigned act on MySpace, but their first major success was the 2005 single
        "Apologize" from Dreaming Out Loud, their debut album with Interscope Records. It would become a worldwide hit
        with a remix by Timbaland in 2007.
        Tedder was poised to be a pop star when he snagged a record deal and publishing contract on an MTV singing
        competition hosted by 'N Sync's Lance Bass in 2000. But the reality of reality TV sunk in fast. Tedder
        remembered in a BBC News interview: "And then two weeks after being on MTV, I was waiting tables picking up
        chips off the floor. It turned into nothing. It was all on paper - it wasn't real. It was just a bunch of hype
        that didn't turn into anything."
        Zach Filkins spent his childhood studying classical guitar in Barcelona, Spain. He would land in Colorado
        Springs in his teen years, where he would meet bandmate Ryan Tedder in his senior year of high school.
        If you spot a familiar torso on a package of underwear it could be Filkins, who scored a few gigs as a model.
        His torso was used on packages of Covington and Jockey Underwear.
        Filkins played a forest ranger on the CBS drama Criminal Minds in the season 7 episode "Epilogue."
        Tedder co-wrote hits for several other artists, including Leona Lewis ("Bleeding Love"), Beyoncé ("Halo"), and
        Kelly Clarkson ("If I Can't Have You").
        Brent Kutzle made a cameo appearance as a cellist at the beginning of the 2008 horror flick The Eye.
        Native, the band's third album, was their first to reach the Top 10 on the Billboard 200 chart, where it peaked
        at #4 in 2013.
